## Statistics and data science

- Statistics, the science of _data analysis_, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century.

- Data is increasing in [volume, velocity, and variety](http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/).

## Course desciption

- This course introduces some computing skills and software tools for handling potentially big public health data.

- Read [syllabus](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/syllabus.html) and [schedule](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/schedule.html) for a tentative list of topics and course logistics.
