1. SSH client on MacOS and Windows. 
    - MacOS: just open the `Terminal` app.  
    - Windows: download and install [`Git for Windows` aka `Git Bash`](https://gitforwindows.org). Accept default settings during the installation process.  This gives you a bash shell within Windows, which is also equipped with Git commands.

2. Connect to the teaching server. On MacOS Terminal or Windows Git Bash:  
    ```
    ssh username@server.ucla-biostat-203b.com
    ```
If you cannot connect, you may not have an account. Ask TA or instructor for help.

3. Change password on teaching server
    ```
    passwd
    ```

4. On teaching server, you can obtain a copy of the course material using git:  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ucla-biostat203b-2020winter/ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io.git
    ```
To reproduce commands in the [Linux lecture](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux/linux.html), make sure you are in the correct folder
    ```
    cd ~/ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux
    ```
