1. Check whether you already have SSH keys at default location. On Linux/MacOS terminal or Windows Git Bash:
    ```
    ls -al ~/.ssh
    ```
   
2. If no SSH keys yet, generate a pair of SSH RSA keys
    - Method 1: generate keys on MacOS Terminal or Windows Git Bash. Follow [instructions in lecture notes](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux/linux.html#steps-to-generate-keys).  
    - Method 2: Use RStudio to generate keys. Tools -> Global Options... -> Git/SVN. 
Using either method, make sure keys are in the default location `~/.ssh/`

3. Register an account on GitHub Student Developer Pack, **using ucla.edu email**. Send GitHub handle to Juhyun Kim.

4. Set up seemless SSH connection between (1) laptop, (2) teaching server, and (3) GitHub.

5. Intitialize a project from GitHub within RStudio. Make sure use the Git address instead of the HTTPS address.

6. Basics of RMarkdown.

7. QA and hints for HW1.
