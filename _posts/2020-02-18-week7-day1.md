## Today

- Databases.

- Cloud computing using GCP.

## Announcements

- TA office hours changed to Friday 1p-2p (only this week).

- I messed up the teaching server yesterday ðŸ˜žand need to rebuild the server. Make sure you always commit your changes and push to GitHub.  Lessons I learnt:  
    1. Be extremely cautious with `rm -rf folder`. It's very hard to recover a deleted folder in Linux.  
    2. Always back up the system.  
    3. GitHub comes as a rescue so we don't lose important work.
